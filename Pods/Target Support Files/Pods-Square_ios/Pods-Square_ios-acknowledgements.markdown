The software license is based on the 3-clause "New BSD License", with an attribution requirement added.  Basically you can use this code, original or modified, in your own products, including commercial and/or closed-source products.  The only 2 things I ask are:\
\
1. Include the full 
\f1\b\fs26 \cf4 \cb2 License Agreement
\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 \cb2  text below.\
2. Include a credit mentioning me as the original author of the source (e.g. 
\b \cb2 Includes MPFlipViewController by Mark Pospesel
\b0 \cb2 ).  I would prefer that this credit be in the software's "About" window, but it could also be included in the list of Acknowledgments, in the software's documentation, or on the software's website.\
\
If you need an attribution-free version of this license for use in a product, please contact me via one of the methods listed under {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://markpospesel.com/about"}}{\fldrslt http://markpospesel.com/about}}
